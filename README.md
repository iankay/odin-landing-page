# landing-page

Odin Project

Project to create a webpage, in conformance to design guidelines provided by The Odin Project.

03/11/23 My first attempt was a mock-up of a fictional interplanetary tourism service for aliens looking to vacation on earth. I wasn't feeling the theme, so I scrapped the items in the repository and started over. 

03/12/23 My latest, and final attempt at this project, is a theme involving the cyberpunk genre. It's a service provider landing-page for ripperdocs, or doctors who perform body modificiatons involving cybernetics. I've also cleaned up some css this time around. Followed most of the design guidelines for project, but strayed a bit regarding font choice.
